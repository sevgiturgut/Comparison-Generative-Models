"""
PBMC3K is a Seurat tutorial dataset that contains single-cell RNA-seq data from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
This script demonstrates how to perform basic preprocessing, normalization, variable feature selection, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization using the Seurat package in R.
